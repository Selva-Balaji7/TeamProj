IN SQL WORKBENCH:

In MySQL, a schema is essentially a database. It is a container that holds tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, and other database objects.

Creating a Schema in MySQL
 using the CREATE SCHEMA or CREATE DATABASE command.

Database and table creation: 

Relationship Type	Implementation
One-to-One (1:1)	PK → PK (or Unique FK)
One-to-Many (1:M)	PK → FK
Many-to-One (M:1)	FK → PK
Many-to-Many (M:N)	Junction Table (2 FKs)




1.User table:
    Users have a one-to-many relationship with Attendance (one user can have
multiple attendance records).
	Users have a one-to-many relationship with Leave Requests (one user can
submit multiple leave requests).
	Users have a many-to-one relationship with Roles (each user has one role,
but each role can belong to many users).
